Graph clustering is the process of grouping nodes in a graph such that nodes within the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to nodes in different clusters. One of the primary challenges in graph clustering is determining the correct number of clusters. This is crucial because different applications might have varying numbers of underlying clusters, and using an incorrect number of clusters can lead to inaccurate results.
